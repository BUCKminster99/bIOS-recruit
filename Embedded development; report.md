## Challenge 1.
1) Make a 3 bit full adder using 8x1 mux and Arduino (Arduino should be used to adjust the select lines).

First i made an 8x1 mux using 7- 2x1 mux(there was no direct way to impelement 8x1 in WOKWI.com). Then i connected 8 input and 3 select lines to the Arduino. Then, i took the ouutputs from the truth table of full adder and pre set the vlaues of inputs which bear an output value of 1. Thus full adder is obtained from mux.For the carry, you have to change the values of inputs according to the truth table  of the carry.
